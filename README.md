This site was made to specification for LoanDepot as a Code Challenge.

## Summary

I created this site with the Angular 2 framework using Angular-CLI to generate and scaffold the project.

[Cloud9](https://c9.io) was the IDE I used to build the project.

While building the site, I assumed that it would be run on the latest version of Google Chrome. Angular 2 is still very new and experimental, and as such the animation components in Angular 2 do not seem to display properly in Firefox or IE.

I designed the app using best-practices according to the Angular 2 documentation. Angular-CLI was very helpful in that regard.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) which itself requires Node 4 or higher and NPM 3 or higher.

## Run Locally

**Before you can clone this repo and run it there are a few [prerequisites](#prerequisites) you will need.**

After you have the prerequesites installed, if you are running on a local environment, navigate to root and run `ng serve`.
Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and the app should be running.

If you are running on a cloud environment, such as [Cloud9](https://c9.io), you will need to run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.
Then you may navigate to your Cloud9 preview URL.
